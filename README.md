### About the App 

This is a Java program that checks if a number is even or odd. The program prompts the user to enter an integer value

for the size of an ArrayList and then prompts the user to enter that many integers. The program then uses a method called even_Checker

to check which of those integers are even and returns an ArrayList containing only those even integers.
